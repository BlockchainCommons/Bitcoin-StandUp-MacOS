> *Bitcoin-Standup* is a open source project and a suite of tools that helps users to install a [Bitcoin-Core](https://bitcoin.org/) full-node on a fresh computer or VPS and to add important privacy tools like onion services and eventually optional Bitcoin-related tools like [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [C-Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora), [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver), etc., as well as emerging technologies like Bitcoin-based Decentralized Identifiers.
>
> This tool will also harden and secure your OS to current best practices, as well as adding sufficient system tools to support basic Bitcoin development. After setup, *Bitcoin-Standup* will present a QR code and/or special URI that can be used to securely link your full-node to other devices, such as your mobile phone (for instance using [StandUp-Remote](https://github.com/FontaineDenton/StandUp-Remote) on iOS) or a remote desktop.
>
> Once installed and fully synced, a *Bitcoin-Standup* full node can also be used with developer education courses like [Learning Bitcoin from the Command Line](https://github.com/ChristopherA/Learning-Bitcoin-from-the-Command-Line).

## Background

The most important reason to operate a Bitcoin full node is validation. With a full node, Bitcoin users can check whether transactions are valid according to all of Bitcoin's rules. Users can verify that any bitcoins they receive are legitimately mined, correctly signed, and more. This is what makes Bitcoin a trustless solution.

(TODO: Rewrite this paragraph, add other basic reasons why having your own full node rather than relying on others is powerful.)

## Financial Support

*Bitcoin-Standup* is a project of [Blockchain Commons, LLC](https://www.blockchaincommons.com/) a ‚Äúnot-for-profit‚Äù benefit corporation founded with the goal of supporting blockchain infrastructure and the broader security industry through cryptographic research, cryptographic & privacy protocol implementations, architecture & code reviews, industry standards, and documentation.

## Functionality

The application *Bitcoin Standup.app* currently installs, configures, and launches `tor stable v0.4.2.5` and `bitcoin-core v0.19.0.1`. The app is under development and as it stands will install and configure a Bitcoin Core full node, Tor as a service, a Tor V3 hidden service controlling each  `rpcport` with native client cookie authentication. The app allows the user to set custom settings including `txindex`, `prune`, `walletdisabled`, `testnet`, `mainnet`, `datadir` which should not interfere with any exisiting bitcoin.conf settings. It offeres a simple `go private` option which closes off your node to the clearnet only accepting connections over Tor. The user may refresh their hidden service at the push of a button.

The default `bitcoin.conf` StandUp.app will create is:
```
testnet=1
walletdisabled=0
rpcuser=arandomstring
rpcpassword=astrongrandompassword
server=1
prune=0
txindex=1
rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
bindaddress=127.0.0.1
proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
listen=1
debug=tor
[main]
rpcport=8332
[test]
rpcport=18332
[regtest]
rpcport=18443
```

If there is an exisiting `bitcoin.conf` in your `datadir` then *Bitcoin Standup.app* will simply check for and add `rpccredentials` if they are missing. 

Once the app has completely installed and launched Bitcoin, it will present a *Quick Connect QR code* which can be used to securely link your full node remotely over Tor to other devices, such as the iOS application[StandUp-Remote](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8) and [StandUp-Remote](https://github.com/FontaineDenton/StandUp-Remote).

The app currently relies on initial installation of [Strap.sh](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/) to install basic development tools before installing `tor` and `bitcoin-qt`. This tool also does some basic hardening of your Macintosh including turning on FileVault (the full-disk encryption services offered in macOS), turning on your Mac firewall, and turning off Java. Future versions of *Bitcoin Standup* will integrate *Strap.sh* features directly to offer additional macOS hardening configuration options.

### iOS - remote app

The iOS application *FullyNoded 2* utilizes your Bitcoin Core node as a backend, offering you a relatively secure, private, self sovereign means of accessing, spending, and receiving your Bitcoin on the go. Once you scan a QuickConnect QR code the app will automatically start firing off a carefully constructed list of RPC commands to your node to create a special type of wallet whereby no private keys are stored on your node. The iOS device holds your encrypted seed and simply derives the correct private keys to sign transactions with on demand whenever you go to spend, *never* reusing a private key or address. FullyNoded 2 is a powerful but simple to use wallet that offers both advanced and basic functionality, giving users full control over their seed with the ability to import seeds.

Because the app is accessing your node over Tor you may put your Bitcoin Core machine completely behind a firewall with no port forwarding whatsoever to access your node anywhere in the world, self sovereignty at its finest.

- Full integrated Tor
- Full coin control
- Segwit, legacy and segwit wrapped addresses all compatible (BIP44, BIP84, BIP49)
- Import seeds
- Utilize your BIP39 recovery phrase with your own node
- Customize derivation paths

To see all the details please visit the dedicated github [readme here](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Bitcoin-Standup/tree/master/iOS/FullyNoded-2)

## Install

### macOS Install

#### Mac Dependencies

- macOS v10.15 Catalina (may work on earlier versions, not tested yet)
- ~300 GB of free space if you want to have a full node with txindex. ~20 GB for a testnet3 full node. Both can be substantially less if the full-node is pruned.
- Install [Strap](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap) by [@MikeMcQuaid](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid)

#### Instructions for installation on macOS

Start by installing *Strap*, a script hosted on Github for bootstrapping a minimal development environment, intended for a new Mac or a fresh install of macOS. *Bitcoin-Standup* currently relies on *Strap* to bootstrap a macOS system before installing Bitcoin and tools.

***WARNING:*** Be careful about using GitHub bash scripts on existing systems as they can compromise your computer. Use these scripts on new systems only. We also suggest you view the [script](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/blob/master/bin/strap.sh) in advance, and only execute it if you trust the source. [@MikeMcQuaid](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid) is the open source [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) Project's lead maintainer and also a senior member of the GitHub staff.

1. Run the *Strap* script on your Mac. After a fresh macOS install either:
   - Execute the *Strap* script directly from your Mac's CLI (command line interface)
     1. Execute these commands to install *Strap* via the *Terminal* app's command line interface (to start *Terminal* type command + space + "terminal"):
     ```bash
     curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/master/bin/strap.sh > ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     bash ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     ```
   - OR Clone the *Strap* repo to your Mac and then execute the script.
     1. Execute these commands to clone *Strap*'s GitHub repository via the *Terminal* app's command line interface (to start *Terminal* type command + space + "terminal"):
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap
     cd strap
     bash bin/strap.sh
     # or `bash bin/strap.sh --debug` for more debugging output
     ```
   - OR Use the [*Strap* heroku web app](https://macos-strap.herokuapp.com/). This web application will request a temporary Github secure access token for your use, allowing you use the *strap.sh* script to automatically install and download from your own personal GitHub repository `.dotfiles` and install additional apps from a `.Brewfile`. This token is solely used to add the GitHub access token to your `strap.sh` download and is not otherwise used by this web application or stored anywhere.
     1. Open https://macos-strap.herokuapp.com/ in your web browser. Click on the `strap.sh` button.
     2. Login to your GitHub account.
     3. Download `strap.sh` to your `~/Downloads/` folder
     4. Execute this command via the *Terminal* app's command line interface (to start *Terminal* type command + space + "terminal"):
     ```bash
     bash ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     ```
     5. After *strap.sh* has finished processing, delete the customized `strap.sh` (it has a GitHub acces token in it) by executing:
     ```bash
     rm ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     ```
2. After running the *Strap* script, download and run the *Bitcoin Standup.app*

#### Install *StandUp.app*

To use the MacOS app you may download the `StandUp_Export.zip` from this [public google drive link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lXyl_zO6WPJN5tzWAVV3p42WPFtyesCR), unzip it and open the folder and you will see `StandUp.app`, if your mac has been strapped or has brew and xcode command line tools installed you will be good to go, just double click it the app to use it.

#### *FullyNoded 2* iOS Testflight

We have a public link available for beta testing [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8), please bear in mind the app may change drastically and may not be backwards compatible, please only use the app on testnet. You will need to first install the [Testflight app](https://testflight.apple.com) onto your device in order to be able to access the testflight beta of FullyNoded 2.

## Security

### Warning

Don‚Äôt configure a VPS with the Bitcoin wallet feature turned on with any significant real funds; see http://blog.thestateofme.com/2012/03/03/lessons-to-be-learned-from-the-linode-bitcoin-incident/ . A higher level of safety is required for significant funds. A VPS-based install can be a useful as a wallet-less full node connected remotely to a more secure wallet that signs the keys elsewhere.

### Tor V3 Authentication using StandUp and StandUp-Remote
Think of your StandUp node as a server, and StandUp-Remote or your iPhone as a client. Tor V3 hidden services have new and improved built in functionality for authenticating client connections to servers, whereby the client stores a private key that is kept secret to everyone only ever existing on the client and the public key is stored in a special directory called `authorized_clients` on your StandUp server which (in StandUp) lives in your `HiddenServiceDir`  > `/usr/local/var/lib/tor/standup/authorized_clients`.

#### The problem:
The QuickConnect QR code that StandUp produces for you contains very sensitive information. If you had a malicious maid in your house or a hacker was remotely recording your computer screen then they would have access to your node and your bitcoin as soon as they got an image of the QuickConnect QR code. If the `authorized_clients` directory is empty then anyone with the QR code has full access to your node.

#### The solution:
Prevent the existence of any single point of failure or "honey pot" (e.g. the QR code).

#### How?
 Two factor authentication whereby a trusted separate isolated device (e.g. the client) produces the private key and public key, which requires the owner of the server to physically add in the public key to the `authorized_clients` directory. In this way there is no "honey pot" which contains all the information necessary to obtain access to your node. Of course if someone has access to your node they can produce their own key pair and add the public key into the hidden service but then again they already have access to your node and hidden service so this attack vector is somewhat irrelevant. What we are trying to accomplish is a method to guarantee that your device (e.g. the client) is the *only* device in the world that is able to remotely access your node. It is highly recommended as an additional layer of security to also encrypt your nodes wallet so that even if someone somehow stole your phone they would still need to brute force your wallet.dat encryption.

 For a detailed guide see [this link](https://github.com/AnarchoTechNYC/meta/wiki/Connecting-to-an-authenticated-Onion-service#connecting-to-authenticated-version-3-onion-services), for a simple video tutorial using StandUp and iOS *StandUp-Remote* see [this link](https://youtu.be/pSm2VftTCBI) (TO DO create demo videos for StandUp-Remote)

**Assuming you have downloaded and installed macOS *StandUp.app* and iOS *StandUp-Remote* **

On *StandUp-Remote* go to settings and tap "Export Authentication Public Key" as pictured below:

<img src="https://github.com/Fonta1n3/Bitcoin-Standup/blob/master/Images/StandUp_Remote_Settings.PNG" alt="export authentication public key" width="250"/>

In *StandUp-Remote* the private key is stored encrypted locally on the device, the user can not access it and the encryption key for the private key is stored on your keychain. Whenever you connect to your node the key is decrypted and stored in your temporary torrc file which is integrated into the *StandUp-Remote* Tor thread.

The public key text which would look like `descriptor:x25519:JNEF892349FH24HF872H4FU2H387H3R982NFN238HF928` is automatically copied to your clipboard for easy copy and pasting or you may scan the QR code with your mac to input the key into the macOS *StandUp.app*.

<img src="https://github.com/Fonta1n3/Bitcoin-StandUp/blob/master/Images/StandUp_Remote_QR.PNG" alt="export the public key" width="250"/>

This public key is not sensitive as it only works in conjunction with the private key.

In this way you can also share access to your node with trusted family and friends. Tor V3 hidden services support up to ~330 different public keys stored in the `authorized_clients` directory (link to source). If you were doing this manually, you would go on your laptop which has *StandUp.app* installed and find your `HiddenServiceDir` which is `/usr/local/var/lib/tor/standup/authorized_clients`. You would then open the `authorized_clients` directory and add a file which contains only the public key exactly as *StandUp-Remote* exports it. The filename must have a `.auth` extension.

But of course you are using *Bitcoin-StandUp* so the process is as easy as a click. In macOS *StandUp.app* go to "Settings" and paste in the public key just as iOS *StandUp-Remote* exported it, then tap "Add".

<img src="https://github.com/Fonta1n3/Bitcoin-StandUp/blob/master/Images/paste.png" alt="paste the public key" width="750"/>

<img src="https://github.com/Fonta1n3/Bitcoin-StandUp/blob/master/Images/yes.png" alt="tap yes" width="750"/>

<img src="https://github.com/Fonta1n3/Bitcoin-StandUp/blob/master/Images/ok.png" alt="tap yes" width="750"/>

macOS *StandUp.app* then simply creates a random filename with a `.auth` extension, writes the public key to it, and saves it to `/usr/local/var/lib/tor/standup/authorized_clients/`.

# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept Pull Requests.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/briandk/transcriptase-atom/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs.

If you find bugs, mistakes, inconsistencies in this project's code or documents, please let us know by [opening a new issue](./issues), but consider searching through existing issues first to check and see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, it never hurts to add a quick "+1" or "I have this problem too". This helps prioritize the most common problems and requests.

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
[This is an example](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) of a good bug report by @briandk. Here's [another example from craig.hockenberry](http://www.openradar.me/11905408).

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [The stackoverflow bug report](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that *anyone* with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Submitting code changes through Pull Requests

Simple Pull Requests to fix typos, document, or fix small bugs are always welcome.

We ask that more significant improvements to the project be first proposed before anybody starts to code as an [issue](./issues) or as a [draft Pull Request](./pulls) (GitHub has a nice new feature for simple Pull Requests called [Draft Pull Requests](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/). This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right direction, give feedback on the design, and maybe point out if related work is already under way.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull Requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your Pull Requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that Pull Request!

## Any code contributions you make will be under the BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood will be available under the same [BSD-2-Clause Plus Patent License](./LICENSE.md) that covers the project. We also ask all code contributors to GPG sign the [CONTRIBUTOR-LICENSE-AGREEMENT.md](./CONTRIBUTOR-LICENSE-AGREEMENT.md) to protect future users of this project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style
* We indent using two spaces (soft tabs)
* We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters ([1, 2, 3], not [1,2,3]), around operators (x += 1, not x+=1), and around hash arrows.
* This is open source software. Consider the people who will read your code, and make it look nice for them. It's sort of like driving a car: Perhaps you love doing donuts when you're alone, but with passengers the goal is to make the ride as smooth as possible.
