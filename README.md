# ðŸ›  Bitcoin-Standup MacOS

*Bitcoin-Standup* is a open source project and a suite of tools that helps users to install a [Bitcoin-Core](https://bitcoin.org/) full-node on a fresh computer or VPS and to add important privacy tools like onion services. It will eventually also support optional Bitcoin-related tools like [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [C-Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora), and [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver) as well as emerging technologies like Bitcoin-based Decentralized Identifiers. *Bitcoin-Standup* strives to provide the community with an easy to use "one-click" set up full-node complete with a purpose built remote app for securely connecting to your node over Tor from anywhere in the world, providing you with a powerful suite of tools.

This tool will also harden and secure your OS to current best practices and will add sufficient system tools to support basic Bitcoin development. After setup, *Bitcoin-Standup* will present a QR code and/or special URI that can be used to securely link your full-node to other devices, such as a remote desktop or a mobile phone using [FullyNoded 2](https://testflight.apple.com/join/OQHyL0a8) or [Fully Noded 1](https://github.com/FontaineDenton/iOS/FullyNoded) on iOS.

This repo includes the MacOS version of Bitcoin-*Standup*, which allows you to run a full node on your Mac computer.

## Status â€” Work-in-Progress

*Bitcoin-Standup* is an early **Work-In-Progress**, so that we can prototype, discover additional requirements, and get feedback from the broader Bitcoin-Core Developer Community. ***It has not yet been peer-reviewed or audited. It is not yet ready for production uses. Use at your own risk.***

## Installation Instructions

You must meet minimum OS and space requirements to install *Bitcoin-Standup* on your Mac. You may install either using *Strap* or using *Xcode*.

### Dependencies

- macOS v10.15 Catalina (may work on earlier versions, not tested yet)
- ~300 GB of free space for a full mainnet node with txindex; or ~20 GB for a full testnet3 node; or substantially less if the full node is pruned.

### Method One: Install Using Strap

Start by installing *Strap*, a script hosted on Github for bootstrapping a minimal development environment, intended for a new Mac or a fresh install of macOS. Then, run the *Bitcoin-Standup* app, which will create your Bitcoin environment using *Strap*.

***WARNING:*** *Be careful about using GitHub bash scripts on existing systems as they can compromise your computer. Use these scripts on new systems only. We also suggest you view the [script](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/blob/master/bin/strap.sh) in advance, and only execute it if you trust the source. [@MikeMcQuaid](https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid) is the open source [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) Project's lead maintainer and also a senior member of the GitHub staff.*

#### Step One: Install Strap

1. Begin with a fresh macOS install.

2. Choose one of the following three methods to install *Strap*.

   - ***Option #1: Install from CLI.*** Install the *Strap* script directly from your Mac's CLI (command line interface)

     1. Run *Terminal*, which is usually available in "Applications > Utilities".
     2. Execute these commands via the *Terminal* app's command line interface:

     ```bash
     curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap/master/bin/strap.sh > ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     bash ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     ```

   - ***Option #2: Install from GitHub.*** Clone the *Strap* repo to your Mac and then execute the script.

     1. Run *Terminal*, which is usually available in "Applications > Utilities".
     2. Execute these commands via the *Terminal* app's command line interface:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/MikeMcQuaid/strap
     cd strap
     bash bin/strap.sh
     # or `bash bin/strap.sh --debug` for more debugging output
     ```

   - ***Option #3: Installing using Heroku.*** Use the [*Strap* heroku web app](https://macos-strap.herokuapp.com/). This web application will request a temporary Github secure access token for your use, allowing you use the *strap.sh* script to automatically install and download from your own personal GitHub repository `.dotfiles` and install additional apps from a `.Brewfile`. This token is solely used to add the GitHub access token to your `strap.sh` download and is not otherwise used by this web application or stored anywhere.

     1. Open https://macos-strap.herokuapp.com/ in your web browser. Click on the `strap.sh` button.
     2. Login to your GitHub account.
     3. Download `strap.sh` to your `~/Downloads/` folder
     4. Run *Terminal*, which is usually available in "Applications > Utilities".
     5. Execute this command via the *Terminal* app's command line interface:

     ```bash
     bash ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     ```

     6. After *strap.sh* has finished processing, delete the customized `strap.sh` (it has a GitHub acces token in it) by executing:

     ```bash
     rm ~/Downloads/strap.sh
     ```


#### Step Two: Install *StandUp.app*

You are now ready to install *Bitcoin-Stanup* using *Strap*:

3. Download the `StandUp_Export.zip` from this [public google drive link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lXyl_zO6WPJN5tzWAVV3p42WPFtyesCR).
4. Unzip `StandUp_Export.zip`.
5. Open the folder and double-click `StandUp.app`.

### Method Two: Build Mac App from source using Xcode


Instead of downloading binaries through *Strap*, you can build *Bitcoin-Standup* by hand using Apple's *Xcode*.

1. Install [*Xcode*](https://itunes.apple.com/id/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12).
2.  [Create](https://developer.apple.com/programs/enroll/) a free Apple developer account.
3. In *XCode*, click "XCode" -> "preferences" -> "Accounts" -> add your GitHub account.
4. On the GitHub repo, click "Clone and Download" > "Open in XCode".
5. When *XCode* launches, press the "play" button in the top left.

### After Installation

Once the app has completely installed (by either method) and once it has launched Bitcoin, it will present a *Quick Connect QR code* that can be used to securely link your full node remotely over Tor to other devices, such as the iOS application [FullyNoded 2](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/FullyNoded-2).
