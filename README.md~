**_GordianServer-macOS_** is a open source project and a suite of tools that helps users to install a [Bitcoin-Core](https://bitcoin.org/) full-node on a fresh computer or VPS and to add important privacy tools like onion services. It will eventually also support optional Bitcoin-related tools like [Electrum Personal Server](https://github.com/chris-belcher/electrum-personal-server), [C-Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning), [Esplora](https://github.com/Blockstream/esplora), and [BTCPay Server](https://github.com/btcpayserver/btcpayserver) as well as emerging technologies like Bitcoin-based Decentralized Identifiers. *GordianServer-macOS* strives to provide the community with an easy-to-use "one-click" setup for a full node, complete with a purpose-built remote app for securely connecting to your node over Tor from anywhere in the world, providing you with a powerful suite of tools.
