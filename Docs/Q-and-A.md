# Q&A about Gordian Server

Inspired by questions asked on the [Discussions-repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions) (Turn on 'Watch' if you want to be notified of conversations), but also the open Telegram *Fully Noded* group [here](https://t.me/FullyNoded) and [Twitter @GordianWallet](https://twitter.com/GordianWallet).

Beware: A Q&A is always *work in progress*. Tips & help welcome.

None of the respondents in the **open** Discussions-repo, **open** Telegram group nor Tweets have been explicitly named as a source, except for ***@Fonta1n3***, ***@ChristopherA***, ***@Appelcline*** and ***@henkvancann***. For practical reasons educational images uploaded by Github members, Telegram group members have been downloaded. We de-personalised them by giving images a new name. Under these new names these images have been uploaded to github and used in the Q&A to clarify the questions and answers.

We've done our best to protect the privacy of the Github, Telegram group members and Twitter accounts by investigating the images we used. We haven't come across personal identifiable information (pii). However, should we have made a mistake after all, please let us know and we'll correct this immediately.

## What is the Gordian System?

It's a full node linked with a mobile wallet. (@Appelcline)

## Why use the Gordian System?

There are a few advantages to this setup:

**Security**. A mobile wallet allows you to keep your private keys away from devices directly connected to the internet.

**Autonomy**. Maintaining your own full node ensures that you can't be censored, tracked, or otherwise taken advantage of by someone else. It ensures your self-sovereignty. (@Appelcline)


## What OSes can the Gordian System run on?

The Gordian server runs on MacOS, though the Bitcoin Standup technology that's at its foundation can also be run on UNIX machines, with the Linodes running Debian being particularly well tested.

The Gordian Wallets runs under iOS. (@Appelcline)
